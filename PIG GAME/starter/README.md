Hi all,
This was a very catchy and funny project to make, one of my favorites by so far!
The game is called Pig Game, and its logic is based on a Java Script course on Udemy, by Jonas Schmedtmann. ( with improvisations I made by myself :))
In this game, there are two players competing against each other.
Player can either roll a dice, or choose to hold on.
Active player wins when he gets to 30 points.
Every time a dice rolls 1 , players current score resets to 0, and the game switches to the other player.
That's why we have a hold option, when active player presses it, it saves his current score and adds it to his total score, and the game switches to other player.

That would be a short summary of this funny game :)
I hope you like it, enjoy!
